description: "I am a post-doctoral researcher with a strong interest in phylogenetics and epidemiology. Following a career as a Veterinary Nurse I returned to Nottingham Trent University and graduated with a BSc in Forensic Biology. I joined Professor Sharon Peacock's research group at The University of Cambridge in 2012 as a research technician. I was involved in a number of large scale clinical sequencing projects and also gained further experience in molecular biology and microbiology. During my PhD in this lab I investigated the tranmsmission of healthcare associated pathogens within and between nursing homes and hospitals. Following completion of my doctorate I joined Dr Estee Torok's newly formed research group at Cambridge where we conducted longitudinal analysis of multi-drug resistant pathogen transmission within intentisive care patients. I am now based here in the Department of Veterinary Medicine undertaking a research project looking at the genomic evolution and global dissemination of Streptococcus equi, which causes the highly contigious disease 'strangles' in horses.

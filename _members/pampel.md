description: "
Julius completed his Bachelor’s and Master’s degrees in Biochemistry at the University of Heidelberg, Germany. For his Master’s thesis, he joined the Shokat Lab at UCSF, where he worked on covalent KRAS inhibitors.

Now back in the Bay Area as a PhD student at UCSF, Julius aims to continue working on covalent KRAS inhibitors and to expand fragment-screening approaches to viral proteins.

In his free time, he enjoys the search for the best cortado in the city and biking across the Golden Gate Bridge.

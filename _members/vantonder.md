description: "I am a research associate with an interest in pathogen genomics, in particular *Mycobacterium bovis* and non-tuberculous Mycobacteria (NTM). I graduated with a BSc (Hons) in Biology and a MRes in Bioinformatics from the University of York in 2006 and 2007 respectively.  Following three years working as a genome analyst at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, I moved to the University of Oxford as a research assistant in the Brueggemann lab in the Department of Zoology.  This position transitioned into a DPhil in Clinical Medicine focusing on pneumococcal genomics and evolution.  Following my graduation in 2017, I took up a post as a postdoctoral fellow in the Parkhill group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute working on *Mycobacterium bovis* transmission dynamics and evolution, and non-tuberculous mycobacteria in cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis patients.  In June 2019, the Parkhill group moved to the Department of Veterinary Medicine where I’m currently based."

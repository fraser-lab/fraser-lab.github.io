description: "Galen’s research interest lies in using structural biology to tackle problems in protein engineering and drug design. He earned his Ph.D. from the Australian National University, where he worked with [Dr. Colin Jackson](https://chemistry.anu.edu.au/people/academics/prof-colin-jackson) on the structure, function and evolution of insect enzymes that detoxify organophosphate nerve agents.


In the Fraser lab, Galen is using recently developed methods in fragment-based drug discovery to guide the design of new inhibitors of an emerging anti-cancer therapeutic target."

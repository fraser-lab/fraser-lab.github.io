description: "Galen’s research interest lies in using structural biology to tackle problems in protein engineering and drug design. He earned his , Ph.D. from the Australian National University, where he worked with Dr. Colin Jackson on the structure, function and evolution of insect enzymes that detoxify organophosphate nerve agents.


Galen joined the Fraser lab as a postdoc in May 2019. He is using recently developed methods in fragment-based drug discovery to guide the design of new inhibitors of an emerging anti-cancer therapeutic target."

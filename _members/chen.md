description: "Daphne graduated from UCLA with a degree in Biophysics. As an undergraduate, she studied the effects of chaotropes and kosmotropes on protein hydration layers under the guidance of [Dr. Giovanni Zocchi](https://zocchi.physics.ucla.edu).


She discovered her interest in structural biology when she spent a summer working under [Dr. Kliment Verba](https://verbalab.ucsf.edu) at UCSF, and will pursue structural biology-related projects as a member of the Fraser lab.


Outside of lab, Daphne enjoys exploring San Francisco, playing video games, reading, and playing with her cat [Lilly](/pets/#Lilly)."

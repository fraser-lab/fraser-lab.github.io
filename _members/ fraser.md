description: "James was an undergraduate at McGill University, where he worked in the lab of [Dr. Francois Fagotto](https://www.crbm.cnrs.fr/team/morphogenesis/?lang=en) on [Xenopus developmental biology](/publications#20974811).
During the summers, he returned to his hometown of Toronto and worked in [Dr. Alan Davidson's lab](http://individual.utoronto.ca/Davidsonlab/) on TetR repressor biophysics and [bacteriophage genomics](/publications#16631788).


He moved to California in 2005 to do his Ph.D. in [Molecular and Cellular Biology at UC Berkeley](http://mcb.berkeley.edu).
There, he worked with [Dr. Tom Alber](http://fraserlab.com/2014/04/04/Tom-Alber/) creating  biophysical methods to characterize [protein side chain flexibility](/publications#20499387) in [high resolution](/publications#17573816) X-ray [electron density maps](/publications#24363322).
They applied these techniques to study connections between [conformational dynamics and enzymatic catalysis](/publications#19956261), showing that [room temperature](/publications#21918110), but not standard cryogenic, X-ray data collection could reveal the structural basis for critical functional motions.


Near the end of his Ph.D., he was an [EMBO Short-Term Fellow](http://www.embo.org/funding-awards/fellowships/short-term-fellowships) in [Dr. Dan Tawfik's lab](https://www.weizmann.ac.il/Biomolecular_Sciences/obituary/prof-dan-tawfik) at the Weizmann Institute of Science.
Concurrently, he authored the problems and solutions manual for the physical chemistry textbook [The Molecules of Life](http://www.garlandscience.com/product/isbn/9780815341888) by Kuriyan, Konforti, and Wemmer.


In January 2011, James started his [independent career](http://fellows.ucsf.edu/) as a [QB3 at UCSF Fellow](http://qb3.ucsf.edu/events/mini-bio-james-fraser.shtml) affiliated with the [Department of Cellular and Molecular Pharmacology](http://cmp.ucsf.edu/).
In January 2013, he was appointed as an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences](http://bts.ucsf.edu) and the California Institute for Quantitative Biosciences ([QB3](http://qb3.org)) with promotion to Associate Professor in 2016, and Full Professor in 2020. From 2022-2023, he was Vice Dean of Research for the [UCSF School of Pharmacy](https://pharmacy.ucsf.edu/). Since August 2023, he has been the Ernest L. Prien Professor and Chair of the [Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences](https://pharmacy.ucsf.edu/news/2023/08/fraser-named-chair-ucsf-department-bioengineering-therapeutic-sciences).


The lab is also part of the [Macromolecular Structure Group at UCSF](http://msg.ucsf.edu). We maintain a deep connection with Macomolecular Crystallography [Beamline 8.3.1.](http://bl831.als.lbl.gov/~mcfuser/), directed by [Dr. James Holton](http://bl831.als.lbl.gov/~jamesh/), at the [Advanced Light Source](http://www-als.lbl.gov/). James is also a Faculty Scientist in the Molecular Biophysics and Integrated Bioimaging Division of Lawrence Berkeley National Lab, and Associate Director of the [Quantitative Biosciences Initiative](https://qbi.ucsf.edu/). He is the Program Director the [OpenADMET](https://openadmet.org/) project, which integrates funding from ARPA-H and the Gates Foundation to accelerate drug discovery by focusing on the \"anti-targets\" that most projects seek to avoid.


In addition to all the exciting developments in the lab, James has long standing interests in [teaching](/courses), [baseball statistics](http://ibiomagazine.org/issues/november-2011-issue/james-fraser-a-michael-eisen.html), and [juggling](https://pharmacy.ucsf.edu/news/2020/10/labs-juggle-community-distance-during-covid-19). James was also on the board of ASAPbio, a non-profit organization dedicated to accelerating the pace of scientific discovery by making research outputs more accessible and reusable. The lab is committed to [publishing our code](https://github.com/fraser-lab), disseminating our datasets, posting manuscripts on preprint servers, and [participating in open peer review](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hYG5wTGh6aw&list=PLezPfyQ6lSolc6sOZ-an18oG3mZojuwb6&t=1280s). 

He is the co-creator of [UCSF Talks](https://ucsftalks.com), an aggregator of all the discovery science seminars at UCSF.

His full conflicts of interest are available [here](/coi)."

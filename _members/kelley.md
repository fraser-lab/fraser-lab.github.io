description: "Alexis graduated from UC Merced with a degree in Applied Mathematics with emphasis in Computational Biology. During undergrad, she studied prostate cancer heterogenity and used predictive modeling to study cells that undergo Intermittent Androgen Suppression Therapy with [Dr. Erica Rutter](https://www.ucmerced.edu/content/erica-rutter) at UC Merced. Alexis has also completed other projects in prostate cancer and antigen-antibody interactions at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the University of Southern California.


In the Fraser lab, Alexis will use enzymology and structural biology to identify PROSS mutants of mouse Acidic Mammalian Chitinase (mAMCase) that improve expression and solubility in bacteria, and enzyme activity against complex chitin substrates.


When not in the lab, Alexis enjoys playing jazz trumpet, exploring new places, and relaxing at home."

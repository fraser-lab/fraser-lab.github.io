description: "I am a Research Assistant interested in bacterial pathogenesis and antimicrobial resistance. In 2012 I graduated from the University of Portsmouth with a BSc (Hons) in Applied Biomedical Science, which included a training placement as a Biomedical Scientist in the NHS. Subsequently, I held the roles of Senior Scientist and Laboratory Manager in a clinical pathology laboratory within a specialist veterinary referral centre, working principally in the microbiology department. During this time, I oversaw the implementation of automated identification and sensitivity testing of bacterial pathogens, developed AST protocols and enjoyed being a member of the infection control committee. Meanwhile, I also completed a part-time MSc in Clinical Microbiology, graduating from the University of Nottingham in 2021. I joined the Department of Veterinary Medicine in December 2021 to work on a research project that aims to understand how *Klebsiella pneumoniae* interacts with macrophages. I am looking forward to expanding my knowledge of microbial genomics throughout this project.  "

description: "Iris enjoys working at the interface of structural biology and scientific computing, primarily developing software expanding the capabilities of cutting-edge instrumentation for X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. He earned his Ph.D. in chemistry from UC Berkeley working with Drs. Junko Yano, Vittal Yachandra and Nick Sauter at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory on discovery of the mechanism of water splitting in oxygenic photosynthesis using X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) diffraction. He worked with the Sauter group to develop XFEL diffraction data processing methods, including the cctbx.xfel program for real-time feedback at XFEL experiments, and with the Yano/Yachandra group to solve several of the first high-resolution room temperature structures and the first high-resolution transient state structures of photosystem II, revealing the sequence of changes at the heterometallic cluster that catalyzes oxygen evolution.


As a postdoc with the Fraser group, he is collaborating with Alexis Rohou at Genentech to expand on the cisTEM software for macromolecular structure determination by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). This project aims to improve the quality of reconstructions from particularly difficult datasets, both by reducing overfitting artifacts and by embedding parameters for particle flexibility into the maps themselves. He is also working on tools built on the Computational Crystallographic Toolbox (ccbtx) to detect unmodeled features in electron density such as post-transcriptional modifications ([qPTxM](https://github.com/fraser-lab/qptm)) or Hoogsteen base pairs ([curiosity](https://github.com/fraser-lab/curiosity)). During the COVID-19 pandemic he has served as co-lead of the crystallography subgroup of the [Structural Biology Consortium](https://qbi.ucsf.edu/qcrg/structuralbiology), associated with the [QBI Coronavirus Research Group](https://qbi.ucsf.edu/) at UCSF, pursuing the discovery of compounds inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection.


Outside of lab, Iris enjoys reading, sewing, throwing pottery, learning languages, and his cat [Rory](/pets/#Rory). He measures his coffee intake in LD50s.


Iris is supported by a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NIGMS](https://www.nigms.nih.gov/)."

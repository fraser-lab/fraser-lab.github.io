description: "Brandi received her Ph.D. from UC Davis with Dean Tantillo, where she applied computational chemistry to explain complex reaction mechanisms, conformation-activity relationships of potential pharmaceuticals, and non-covalent interactions in small organic molecules. In the Fraser lab,  she will use computational and experimental techniques to develop methods to account for conformational ligand heterogeneity and allosteric binding sites."

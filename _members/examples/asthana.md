description: "Pooja received her Ph.D. from the University of Oulu in Finland. Her thesis  focused on the structural characterization of mycobacterial membrane proteins using X-ray crystallography and small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS).


In the Fraser lab, Pooja will utilize both X-ray crystallography and cryo-EM to study the drug complexes of tubulin and understand the molecular mechanism of resistance of anti-parasitic drugs.


Outside of lab, Pooja enjoys long walks and board games."

description: "I am a research associate with an interest in pathogen genomics, especially foodnorne pathogens such as *E. coli* and *S. enterica*. I graduated with a BSc in Biology from the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki in 2015. The following academic year I joined the PalaeoBARN lab, at the University of Oxford, as an Erasmus exchange student and started my training in ancient DNA wet lab techniques and bioinformatic analyses. This position transitioned into a DPhil in Archaeological Science focusing on ancient DNA metagenomics and zoonotic pathogen evolution. Following the completion of my DPhil in 2021, I took up a post as a postdoctoral research assistant in the Parkhill group at the Vet School in the University of Cambridge working on *E. coli*, and other foodorne pathogens, transmission dynamics and evolution."

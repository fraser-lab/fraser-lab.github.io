description: "Adam graduated from Whitman College with a double major in mathematics and biophysics, biochemistry, and molecular biology (BBMB), where he studied protein function using X-ray crystallography. He earned his PhD in biomedical sciences from Oregon Health & Science University in the lab of Dr. Steven Mansoor, where he studied the modulation and gating of P2X receptors, a family of seven ATP-gated ion channels implicated in a wide range of physiological and pathophysiological processes across the body. In the Fraser lab, Adam will continue pursuing his interest in the structural pharmacology of ion channels by investigating undesirable small molecule interactions with the hERG ion channel as part of the AVOID-OME project. Outside of lab, Adam enjoys all forms of kayaking, disc golf, tennis, and eating delicious food."

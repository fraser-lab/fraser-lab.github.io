description: "I am a Research Assistant working primarily on bacterial genomics and the microbiome of the respiratory tract. While studying part time at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine in 2007, I started working in the Sequencing Production team at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. I did my final research project there on the identification of mixed genotype Plasmodium falciparum infections using the newly developed Illumina sequencing platform, under the supervision of Professor Dominic Kwiatkowski. In 2008 I took a Research Assistant position with Professor Julian Parkhill on the Pathogen Genomics team, where I went on to focus on novel capsule biosynthesis genes in Streptococcus pneumoniae, the human microbiota, and mitigating contamination in low biomass samples. I joined the Department of Veterinary Medicine in 2019."

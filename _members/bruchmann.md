description: "I am a research associate with an interest in microbial functional genomics, in particular *Klebsiella pneumoniae* and other Enterobacteriaceae species (*Salmonella Typhimurium*, *Enterobacter cloacae*).
After graduating from the Technical University of Braunschweig/Germany, I joined to lab of Susanne Häussler at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research. During my PhD I used deep transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq) to study Antimicrobial Resistance in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Klebsiella pneumoniae*. Following a short post-doc in the same group where I developed rapid molecular diagnostics to detect hospital outbreaks and antibiotic resistance in several different bacterial species (mainly, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Klebsiella pneumoniae*, *Escherichia coli* and *Clostridium difficile*). In 2017, I took up a post as a postdoctoral fellow in the Parkhill group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute using Functional Genomics (RNA-sequencing and transposon-directed insertion site sequencing, TraDIS) to understand the antimicrobial stress response in the Enterobacteriaceae species *Klebsiella*, *Salmonella* and *Enterobacter*. In my current work at the Department of Veterinary Medicine I am using different sequencing-based methods to understand how the human pathogen *Klebsiella pneumoniae* interacts with the immune system, in particular macrophages.

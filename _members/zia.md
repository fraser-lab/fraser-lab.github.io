description: "I am a PhD student with a strong interest in genomic epidemiology and phylogenetics. My work is focussed on the genomic epidemiology of ESBL-*E. coli*. My research is based on a ‘One Health’ concept and I will be investigating the transmission of resistant strains between humans, animals and the environment using phylogenetics and genomic epidemiology. I recently joined the Parkhill group as a PhD Student in the Department of Veterinary Medicine. I'm a veterinarian by profession and before joining the group I was working as a Lecturer in the Department of Epidemiology and Public Health, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences, Pakistan. I'm also looking forward to working with genomic epidemiology as a tool to help investigate disease outbreaks in animals in the future."

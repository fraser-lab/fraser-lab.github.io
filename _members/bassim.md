description: "I graduated from Aix Marseille university in France with a Ph.D. degree in structural biochemistry. During my Ph.D., I studied, at the functional and structural levels, two component systems involved in the virulence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After that, I joined the structural motility team at Curie Institute in Paris as a postdoctoral researcher. My project aimed to understand how does the human cardiac myosin interacts with other proteins and how dysfunction can lead to hypertrophic cardiomyopathies.
​


At UCSF, I will manage the [X-ray Crystallography Core](https://sites.google.com/view/ucsf-xray-internal/home). I will also be involved in identifying new anti-viral compounds by X-ray crystallography.


Outside the lab, I enjoy listening to music, shopping, hiking, and discovering new places around the world."

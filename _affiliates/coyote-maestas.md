description: "Willow graduated from the Evergreen State College with degrees in Chemistry and Environmental studies. As an undergraduate in [Dr. Anitra Ingalls’s](https://sites.google.com/view/anitra-ingalls) lab at the University of Washington, he studied how B vitamins mediate microbial interactions and diversity in the open ocean. For graduate school, Willow did his Ph.D. in [Dr. Daniel Schmidt’s](http://www.biologyplus.org) lab at the University of Minnesota, where he developed massively parallel sequencing-based methods to study and engineer proteins. Using mutational and insertional scanning methods, Willow found these methods can be useful for identifying regions of a protein involved in functionally meaningful conformational changes, developed mechanistic models for how to assemble protein domains to create useful multi-domain protein tools, and studied the evolution of ion channel regulation.


As an [HHMI Hanna Gray](https://www.hhmi.org/programs/hanna-h-gray-fellows-program#Fellows) and [QBI Fellow](https://fellows.ucsf.edu), Willow is inventing high-throughput sequencing-based biophysics and biochemistry methods for understanding how a genetic, chemical, or physical perturbations alters the trafficking or functional state of receptors. The long-term goal of this work is to build mechanistic holistic models of how receptors break in disease and work in normal physiology"

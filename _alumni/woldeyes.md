description: "Rahel graduated from University of Minnesota – Twin cities with B.S in Biochemistry and Chemistry. As an undergraduate student, she worked in several labs on projects ranging from cell to structural biology. In the Fraser lab, Rahel will be studying the structure-dynamics-function relationships of proteins and protein-ligand complexes using a combination of room temperature X-ray Crystallography and NMR approaches. Furthermore, she will be developing and implementing methods to dissect allostery in drug targets.



Rahel is supported by a graduate fellowship from NSF."

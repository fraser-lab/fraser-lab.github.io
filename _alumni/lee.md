description: "John earned his Ph.D. working with [Dr. Michael Burkart](http://burkartlab.ucsd.edu) at UC San Diego. His primary focus was the application of protein NMR to the carrier proteins central to fatty acid, polyketide, and non-ribosomal peptide synthetic pathways.


In the Fraser lab, John uses structural and computational techniques to explore structural biology and study minor conformational states.


John is supported by a Kirschstein NRSA (F32) fellowship from [NIH/NIAID](https://www.niaid.nih.gov/)."

# Inquiry Immersion 2022 -  DRUG DESIGN: Why is it so hard to design new small molecule drugs? #

**INSTRUCTORS**

- [James Fraser](mailto:jfraser@fraserlab.com) (Lead Instructor)
- [Tom Goddard](mailto:goddard@sonic.net) (Chimera tutorial)
- [John Irwin](mailto:John.Irwin@ucsf.edu) (Docking lecture)
- [Tanja Kortemme](mailto:kortemme@cgl.ucsf.edu) (Protein Design lecture)

**LOCATION**
The Zoom where it happens!

**OVERVIEW**

Structure-based drug design promises to revolutionize drug discovery, yet despite decades of promise, progress remains intermittent. This course will give students an appreciation for the experimental and computational advances that have led to this optimism, while also pointing out the limitations that currently prevent completely unattended design.

**MINI COURSE OBJECTIVES**

- Identify an urgent and significant gap in medical knowledge and/or practice.
- Propose rationale and novel strategies to address that gap in medical knowledge and/or practice using tools and techniques germane to the relevant Domain(s) of Science.
- Engage with researchers working on the topic explored and collaborate on potential scholarly research.

**TOPIC OBJECTIVES**

- Employ visualization software to examine small molecule drugs in their binding sites.
- Contrast different discovery strategies (fragments, virtual screening, biologics)
- Propose modification to molecules to increase their potency

**MINI COURSE DEI Focus**

- Diversity: highlighting historically marginalized scientists
- Equity: how can access to resources be made more equitable
- Inclusion: tools that focus on outreach and public education

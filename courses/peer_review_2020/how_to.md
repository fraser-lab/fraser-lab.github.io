# I wrote this for my lab a while ago. I'm hoping the course will generate feedback that will help to improve it!

1. Read the paper fully, making notes about what is clear and what is not.
2. Note technical issues:
  - are there experiments or analyses that need to be done (or reframed)
  - is the paper creating new methods
    * if so how does it compare to other methods
  -  are the intellectual leaps properly justified
3. Note any stylistic issues:
  - are the figures clear or do you need to parse the legend carefully
  - spelling/grammar
  - needless acronyms
  - missing/wrong references
4. Format your first draft:
    - Write 2-3 sentences on the major goals of the paper
    - Assess whether the paper accomplishes   those goals in separate paragraphs
      * in this section focus only on the major   issues that deal with the interpretation  of the data or the data quality
      * each major issue should be its own  paragraph
      * if everything is in order, this can be  relatively brief, rely on your notes on   the technical issues!
    - Clearly state the major successes of the  paper.
        * e.g. "The major success of the paper is   in developing a new model for side chain  conformational heterogeneity".
    - Clearly state the major weakness(es) of   the paper (if any). e.g. "The major weakness  of the paper is that the model proposed is  not tested".
    - Write 1-2 sentences on the place/impact of  this paper in the field.
    - Create a list of "Minor points":
      * list all the minor technical questions  that you have
        * especially important to make sure you   distinguish between things you think are  done incorrectly/incompletely and things  that are just not explained clearly   enough for you to understand them
      * list all the stylistic issues
        * I tend to focus a lot on clarity, but   it's great to have a reviewer who is  eagle-eyed for all issues
    - Note any parts of the paper you do not feel like you are able to assess: "E.g. A significant part of the paper relies on a sophisticated analysis of mass spectrometry. I cannot offer expert feedback on the technical merits of this part of the paper."

# Nature family journals also ask these questions (which are good ones to keep in mind):

- What are the major claims of the paper?
- Are they novel and will they be of interest to others in the field?
- If the conclusions are not original, it would be helpful if you could provide relevant references.
- Is the work convincing, and if not, what further evidence would be required to strengthen the conclusions?
- On a more subjective note, do you feel that the paper will influence thinking in the field? (this addresses points 1-4 of my guide)

#Style Guide: Publications
##All sections
  #Indent with two spaces
  #Use double quotes for all string entries

#Authors
#Bold lab member names using the following format: **Last FM**.
#Use one pair of double asterisks for multiple lab members that appear sequentially: **Young ID, Diaz RE, Liu LL**.
#Use &#42; to add an asterisk denoting co-first/corresponding author. Otherwise, bolding of names using **Surname FM** will break.
#For readability of code, start a new line at 140 characters.

#Images and PDFs
#All images and PDFs should be named using the following convention: firstauthorsurname_YYYY

#Leave PMID and PMCID blank until an ID is assigned.
#Do not include additional subsections that are not relevant to a publication (PDB, data, Zenodo, etc).

# Join the Fraser Lab
Our lab welcomes applicants from any race, ethnicity, religion, national origin, gender identity, gender expression, caregiver and family commitments, political affiliation, sexual orientation, and eligible age or disability status. Furthermore, we are committed to maintaining a supportive and collaborative lab environment. We encourage exploratory inquiries!

Our lab doesn’t generally post for specific positions, so please reach out! We are interested in engaging you in a conversation about your scientific background and goals for your future career (in academia, industry, or other ventures). We strive to provide excellent training across a wide range of computational and experimental techniques.

## Graduate Students

At UCSF, students can apply to a single [graduate program](https://graduate.ucsf.edu/prospective-students) and do not apply directly to labs. During the first year of a Ph.D. program, students rotate through ~3 labs prior to deciding on a thesis lab. Our lab is usually open for rotation students every quarter and will generally have room for 1-2 new graduate students (regardless of program affiliation) per year.

##### The Fraser Lab participates in the following UCSF graduate programs:
  * **[Biophysics](http://biophysics.ucsf.edu/)**: The Biophysics Graduate Program (BP) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) prepares scientists to leverage new and emerging research tools—from nanotechnology to nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy—to quantify biological processes in living biological systems using physics and chemistry.
  * **[Chemistry and Chemical Biology](http://ccb.ucsf.edu/)**: The Chemistry and Chemical Biology Graduate Program (CCB) at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) prepares scientists to address problems at the intersection of chemistry and biology by providing a chemical foundation for understanding complex biological processes at an atomic level.
  * **[Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics](http://pspg.ucsf.edu/)**: The Pharmaceutical Sciences and Pharmacogenomics (PSPG) Graduate Program at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) focuses on how to develop effective drug therapies for patients that have a minimum of adverse effects.
  * **[Tetrad](http://tetrad.ucsf.edu/)**: The Tetrad graduate program offers diverse training in Biochemistry & Molecular Biology, Cell Biology, Developmental Biology, & Genetics.

## Postdoctoral Fellows

Inquiries about Postdoctoral positions should be emailed directly to James Fraser. Candidates will be encouraged to explore applying for extramural fellowships to support their research.

## Other Visitors

In the past, our lab has enjoyed having foreign exchange students, interns, sabbatical visitors from academia and industry, and post-bac technicians in the lab.  We are open to other arrangements as well. As we expect people to be fairly compensated for their work by their home institution or by us, we do not have volunteer positions available. Note: we take high school students exclusively through the [UCSF SEP program](http://sep.ucsf.edu/).

<!-- Our lab is in on the UCSF Mission Bay campus in Genentech Hall (600 16th St, San Francisco, CA 94158)
 -->

### The Mission Bay Campus can be reached:  
* #### by public transportation:
  * **Option 1**: Exit BART at the 16th St Station and wait for the free UCSF Red shuttle that stops directly outside [what was once a Burger King and now has lovely graffiti](https://www.google.com/maps/@37.765092,-122.419164,3a,75y,5.38h,82.64t/data=!3m4!1e1!3m2!1sH_jzIrhuF8wnnEp0duvIEQ!2e0) (this option is only available on weekdays: [UCSF Shuttles](http://www.campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/transportation/services/shuttles)).
  * **Option 2**: Exit BART at the 16th St Station and take the 55 Muni Bus towards Mission Bay. Exit at 16th and 4th.
  * **Option 3**: Exit BART at the Embarcadero Station and then take the MUNI T-line inbound to Sunnydale. Exit at the Mission Bay stop on 3rd Street.
  * **Option 4**: Exit Caltrain and then walk along [4th St](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/Caltrain+Bike+Station,+311+Townsend+St,+San+Francisco,+CA+94107/600+16th+St,+San+Francisco,+CA,+USA/@37.7718722,-122.4005542,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x808f7fd683557039:0xcb4ed812802cede8!2m2!1d-122.395387!2d37.776552!1m5!1m1!1s0x808f7fcf1e3cc5ff:0x6e582d4a0ba7d4ca!2m2!1d-122.3922173!2d37.7671496!3e2) for about 10-15 minutes until arriving at UCSF - if the Muni is there, you can get on the T-line inbound and exit at the Mission Bay stop on 3rd Street, but this is often slower than walking.
  * **Option 5**: There are many other shuttle options on the page for [UCSF Shuttles](http://www.campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/transportation/services/shuttles)).
* #### by car:
  * We are at 600 16th Street Street, between Owens and 4th St. There are two parking garages (please park in the  garages and not in the surface lots) on campus that are equally convenient.
  * If being dropped off (by rideshare), use 1675 Owens St, San Francisco, CA 94158 as an address. There is convenient parking circle (red star on the map below) to let a passenger out in between the Rutter center and the parking lot.

### Once on campus, proceed to Genentech Hall:
1. You will have to enter through Genentech Hall from the Koret Quad side (Red arrow on the map below)
2. Sign in at security for a meeting with Dr. James Fraser (office Genentech Hall S472E)
3. Take the elevator or staircase to the fourth floor
4. Walk west down the hall. If the floor changes colour to grey, you have gone the wrong way and are now in Byers Hall. Turn around and walk back to Genentech Hall
5. Make your second left (south) to the S401-484 neighborhood
6. James' office is through the clear doors, the lab is on your right.

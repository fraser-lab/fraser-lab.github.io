# Why Hasn’t Preprint Peer Review Caught On?  

Preprints have transformed how we share science. Posting a preprint is joyful: you upload your work, and it just works. That frictionless experience is a big reason preprinting has become such a success.  

But preprint *peer review* hasn’t taken off in the same way. This week, I realized one surprisingly simple reason why: **authors often don’t even know when feedback happens.**  

## The Notifications Are Missing!

When we give feedback on preprints (all of our reviews are posted [here](https://fraserlab.com/reviews/)), I used to use Disqus, which is embedded into [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/). More recently, we’ve been posting through [PREreview](https://prereview.org/) (including in the graduate-level class we teach on peer review: [details here](https://fraserlab.com/peer_review/)).  

But I've discovered that the authors never find out because:  
- On **[bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/)**, notifications for Disqus comments are *opt-in*. Many authors never enable them.  
- On **[PREreview](https://prereview.org/)**, there are *no notifications at all* unless an author explicitly pre-requests a review.  

This means thoughtful, constructive reviews can easily go unseen. I only realized how widespread this issue is after running into an author who had *never seen* the review my students had written of their preprint. They loved the feedback once they did, but only because I mentioned it to them in person.  

[bioRxiv leadership](https://www.biorxiv.org/) has explained their caution to me: some authors don’t want unsolicited comments, and auto-notifications could feel like spam. But the result is that reviews are written… and no one hears about them.  

I think that posting a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/) is already an explicit invitation for feedback. Authors should not have to “opt in” to learn that constructive, ORCID-authenticated reviews exist — especially when those reviews are linked right in the preprint’s sidebar on the BioRxiv website.  

For now, our workaround will be to email authors directly when we post reviews. But this friction slows down the cultural change toward open, constructive feedback.  

If we want preprints to truly catalyze faster, more open science, then our infrastructure needs to reduce barriers — not create them. Otherwise, we risk shouting into the void while authors miss out on the joy of receiving thoughtful feedback.

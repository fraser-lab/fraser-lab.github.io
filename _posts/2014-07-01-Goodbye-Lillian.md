We celebrated Lillian, the founding member of the Fraser Lab, at the ramp.  She was as sad to leave as we were to see here go:

Liz really outdid herself with some fantastic LCakes:

That were devoured by LCakes herself:

We will miss Lillian tremendously.  But, we take some solace in the fact that she isn't going far. As a student in iPQB in the fall, she can take advantage of a new slide advancer/laser pointer and some "unrestricted" shopping funds:

The second episode of The Tortured Proteins Department is out now!

We chatted about the continued chaos of science infrastructure and dived into some cool science from recent meetings Jaime and Stephanie attended. We introduce two new segments: preprints and how to do science.


The pre-prints discussed in this episode:

- [Counting particles could give wrong probabilities in Cryo-Electron Microscopy](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.27.644168v1)
- [Enthalpy-entropy trade-offs in the evolution of ligand specificity in a superfamily of transcription factors](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.03.23.644840v1)
- [Conserved energetic changes drive function in an ancient protein fold](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.04.02.646877v1)

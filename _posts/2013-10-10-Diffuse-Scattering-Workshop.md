The [Diffuse Scattering Workshop](http://cci.lbl.gov/dials/oct_2013_diffuse.htm) was a great success thanks primarily to the organizational efforts of Nick Sauter. Andrew gave a great talk updating the (growing) diffuse scattering community on his progress. 

Here are some photos from the post-workshop dinner:

I can't believe it has been a week. Tom was my mentor and one of my dearest friends. Tom fought a long battle with what was eventually diagnosed as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.

During the last few years, he showed an incredibly positive spirit as he spent time with friends, colleagues, and family - especially his three children, Josh, Emily, and Mackenzie. Tom loved the outdoors and would often show us pictures of backpacking trips in Tuolumne meadows. He treasured his final trip to Yosemite last fall. He was a scientific force, crafting manuscripts right up until the end. I will miss his optimistic spirit about science and life, and I will always be proud to be part of Team Alber.

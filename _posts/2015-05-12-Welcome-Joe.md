A warm welcome to new UCSF [Faculty Fellow](http://fellows.ucsf.edu) Joe Bondy-Denomy. Joe was a graduate student with [Alan Davidson](http://individual.utoronto.ca/davidsonlab/Davidson_Lab/Home.html) at University of Toronto, which is also the lab that gave me a start in science as an undergraduate. [The Bondy-Denomy Lab](http://bondydenomylab.ucsf.edu) builds on his groundbreaking discovery of naturally occurring anti-CRISPR proteins that antagonize the CRISPR systems that are all the rage in genomics. Welcome Joe!

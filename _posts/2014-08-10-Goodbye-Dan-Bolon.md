[Dan Bolon](http://profiles.umassmed.edu/profiles/display/133553), a professor at UMass Medical School, has spent the last 5 weeks visiting the lab. He has been helping us set up a deep sequencing project that will form the foundation of the iPQB/CCB Project Lab class this fall.  This course, started several years ago by [Joe DeRisi](http://derisilab.ucsf.edu/), aims to have students work in teams through a project-based curriculum. We have an exciting project planned - and we couldn't be happier with the results that came out of Dan's visit. Beyond his steady hands at the bench, we will miss his enthusiasm for the offical lab sport of squash, his journal club paper suggestions, and his rock-solid advice on future research directions. Thanks Dan, please come back soon!

Longtime friend of the lab, [Michael Wall](https://public.lanl.gov/mewall), will be visiting and deliver a seminar on his pioneering work using diffuse X-ray scattering and molecular dynamics to study proteins.

**November 2nd, 2023 4:00pm in LOCATION TBD**

***Diffuse X-Ray Scattering to Shed Light on Protein Dynamics***

**Michael Wall, Los Alamos National Laboratory**


Dynamics in protein crystals gives rise to diffuse X-ray scattering – intensity beneath and between the Bragg peaks in diffraction experiments. Recent improvements in X-ray beamlines and detectors have created new opportunities for using diffuse scattering to understand protein dynamics. In this talk I will introduce some basic concepts about diffuse scattering from protein crystals and the connection to dynamics. I also will review some modern approaches to diffuse data collection, processing, analysis, modeling, and simulation.
